## AI Agent Architecture and Process Flow

Our AI agent has been designed with a modular architecture for ease of understanding, scalability, and maintenance. Here is a simple step-by-step guide to how it processes requests:

1. **Request Reception**: The agent initially receives the request through our endpoint designed to intake user queries.

2. **Preprocessing**: The agent preprocesses the input to make it suitable for processing. This includes steps like tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and other necessary steps based on the application.

3. **Input Processing**: After preprocessing, the processed input data are transformed into a format suitable for our AI model. This again can vary significantly depending on the model we're using.

4. **Model Inference**: The processed input is passed to the AI model, which produces a prediction or output based on its trained knowledge.

5. **Postprocessing**: The output from our AI model is then post-processed to transform it into a format that can be easily understood and used by the users.
   
6. **Response Formation**: Once the output is post-processed, it is packaged in a response format and sent back to the requested endpoint as a final step.

Note: The specifics can vary based on the actual implementation of the AI model and request-handling module.
